ACRISOLS,"strongly weathered acid soils with low base saturation; from L. acris, very acid.","mostly old land surfaces with hilly or undulating topography, in regions with a wet trop-ical/monsoonal, subtropical or warm temperate climate. Light forest is the natural vegetation type.","a general paucity of plant nutrients, aluminium toxicity, strong phosphorus sorption, slaking/crust-ing and high susceptibility to erosion impose severe restrictions on arable land uses. Large areas of Ac-risols are used for subsistence farming, partly in a system of shifting cultivation. By and large, Acrisolsare not very productive soils; they perform best under undemanding, acidity-tolerant crops such as pine-apple, cashew, oil palm or rubber.","0.5"
CAMBISOLS,"soils with beginning horizon differentiation evident from changes in colour, structure orcarbonate content; from L. cambiare, to change.",level to mountainous terrain in all climates; wide range of vegetation types.,"a wide variety of agricultural uses; climate, topography, shallowness, stoniness, or low base statusmay pose restrictions on land use. In steep lands mainly used for grazing and/or forestry.","1"
FERRALSOLS,"red and yellow tropical soils with a high content of sesquioxides; from L. ferrum, iron andaluminium, alum","typically in level to undulating land of Pleistocene age or older; less common on younger,easily weathering rocks. Perhumid or humid tropics; minor occurrences elsewhere are considered to berelics from past eras with a wetter climate than today. ","Ferralsols have good physical properties but are chemically poor. Their low natural fertility andtendency to ‘fix’ phosphates are serious limitations. In natural systems, the limited stock of plant nutri-ents is in a constant process of ‘cycling’ with most nutrients contained in the biomass. Many Ferralsolsare (still) used for shifting cultivation. Liming and full fertilization are required for sustainable seden-tary agriculture.","0.5"
GLEYSOLS,"soils with clear signs of excess wetness; from R. gley, mucky mass.",depression areas and low landscape positions with shallow groundwater.,"wetness is the main limitation of virgin Gleysols; these are covered with natural swamp vegetationand lie idle or are used for extensive grazing. Artificially drained Gleysols are used for arable cropping,dairy farming and horticulture. Gleysols in the tropics and subtropics are widely planted to rice.","0.5"
LEPTOSOLS,"shallow soils; from Gr. leptos, thin.","mostly  land  at  high  or  medium  altitude  and  with  strongly  dissected  topography.  Lep-tosols are found in all climatic zones, in particular in strongly eroding areas.",unattractive soils for arable cropping; limited potential for tree crop production or extensive graz-ing. Leptosols are best kept under forest.,"0"
LIXISOLS,"strongly weathered soils in which clay is washed down from the surface soil to an accu-mulation horizon at some depth; from L. lixivia, washed-out substances.","regions with a tropical, subtropical or warm temperate climate with a pronounced dryseason, notably on old erosional or depositional surfaces. Many Lixisols are (surmised to be) polygen-etic soils with characteristics formed under a more humid climate in the past.",most ‘unreclaimed’ Lixisols are under savannah or open woodland vegetation. Such areas are of-ten used for low volume grazing. Perennial crops or forestry are suitable land uses; arable farming re-quires  recurrent  inputs  of  fertilizers  and/or  lime.  The  unstable  surface  soil  structure  makes  Lixisolsprone to slaking and erosion in sloping land.,"0.5"
PLINTHOSOLS,"soils with ‘plinthite’; from Gr, plinthos, brick"," formation  of  plinthite  is  associated  with  level  to  gently  sloping  areas  with  fluctuatinggroundwater. ‘Petroplinthic’ soils with continuous, hard ‘ironstone’ form where plinthite becomes ex-posed to the surface, e.g. on erosion surfaces that are above the present drainage base. ‘Skeletic’ soilshaving a layer of hardened plinthite concretions occur mostly in colluvial or alluvial deposits. Soft plin-thite is associated with rain forest areas; petroplinthic and skeletic soils are more common in the savan-na zone.",mostly low volume grazing. Arable cropping is hindered by poor rooting conditions associatedwith frequent water logging and/or excessive stoniness and low chemical soil fertility.,"0.5"
NITISOLS,"deep, red, well-drained tropical soils with a clayey ‘nitic’ subsurface horizon that has typ-ical ‘nutty’, polyhedric, blocky structure elements with shiny ped faces; from L. nitidus, shiny.",Nitisols are predominantly found in level to hilly land under tropical rain forest or savan-na vegetation.,"Nitisols are planted to farm and plantation crops. They are generally considered to be ‘fertile’ soilsin  spite  of  their  low  level  of  ‘available’  phosphorus  and  their  normally  low  base  status.  Nitisols  aredeep, stable soils with favourable physical properties.","1"
FLUVISOLS,"soils developed in alluvial deposits; from L. fluvius, river.","periodically flooded areas (unless empoldered) of alluvial plains, river fans, valleys and(tidal) marshes, on all continents and in all climate zones.","Fluvisols are planted to food crops and orchards and many are used for grazing. Flood control,drainage and/or irrigation is normally required. Thionic Fluvisols suffer from severe soil acidity andhigh levels of noxious Al-ions.","1"
PODZOLS,"soils with a ‘spodic’ illuviation horizon under a subsurface horizon that has the appear-ance of ash; from R. pod, under, and zola, ash.","mainly in temperate and boreal regions of the northern hemisphere, in level to hilly landunder heather and/or coniferous forest; in the humid tropics under light forest.","severe acidity, high Al-levels, low chemical fertility and unfavourable physical properties makemost Podzols unsuitable for arable cropping, unless improved, e.g. by deep-plowing and fertilization.Podzols have some potential for forestry and extensive grazing.","0.5"
LUVISOLS,"soils in which clay is washed down from the surface soil to an accumulation horizon atsome depth; from L. luere, to wash.",most common in flat or gently sloping land in cool temperate regions and in warm (e.g.Mediterranean) regions with distinct dry and wet seasons.,Luvisols with a good internal drainage are potentially suitable for a wide range of agricultural usesbecause of their moderate stage of weathering and high base saturation.,"1"
ALISOLS,"strongly acid soils with subsurface accumulation of high activity clays that have morethan 50 percent Al3+ saturation; from L. aluminium, alum."," most common in old land surfaces with a hilly or undulating topography, in humid (sub-)tropical and monsoon climates.","Alisols contain low levels of plant nutrients (except for Mg2+ in some cases) whereas soluble in-organic Al is present in toxic quantities. If liming and full fertilization is no option, use of these soils isgenerally restricted to crops, which accommodate with low nutrient contents and tolerate high levels offree Al. Alisols are traditionally used in shifting cultivation and for low volume production of unde-manding crops. In the past decades, Alisols have increasingly been planted to Al-tolerant estate cropssuch as tea and rubber, and also to oil palm.","0.5"
PLANOSOLS,"soils with a degraded, eluvial surface horizon abruptly over dense subsoil, typically inseasonally waterlogged flat lands; from L. planus, flat.","seasonally or periodically wet, level (plateau) areas, mainly in sub-tropical and temper-ate, semi-arid and sub-humid regions with light forest or grass vegetation.","Planosols are poor soils. In regions with a warm summer season they are mostly under wetlandrice. Elsewhere, Planosols are sown to dryland (e.g. fodder) crops or used for extensive grazing. ManyPlanosol areas are not used for agriculture","0.5"
PHAEOZEMS,"dark soils rich in organic matter; from Gr. phaios, dusky, and R. zemlja, earth, land.","flat to undulating land in warm to cool (e.g. tropical highland) regions, humid enoughthat there is, in most years, some percolation of the soil, but also with periods in which the soil driesout. The natural vegetation is tall grass steppe and/or forest.",Untouched Phaeozems (of which there are few left) carry a grass or forest vegetation. Phaeozemsare fertile soils; they are planted to irrigated cereals and pulses or are used for cattle rearing and fatten-ing on improved pastures. Periodic drought and wind and water erosion are the main limitations.,"1"

VERTISOLS,"churning heavy clay soils; from L. vertere, to turn.","depressions and level to undulating areas, mainly in tropical, semi-arid to (sub)humid andMediterranean climates with an alternation of distinct wet and dry seasons. The climax vegetation issavanna, natural grassland and/or woodland.","Vertisols become very hard in the dry season and are sticky in the wet season. Tillage is difficult,except for a short period at the transition between the wet and dry seasons. Vertisols are productive soilsif properly managed.","1"
REGOSOLS,"soils in the weathered shell of the earth; from Gr. rhegos, blanket.","all climate zones without permafrost and at all elevations. Regosols are particularly com-mon in arid areas, in the dry tropics and in mountain regions.", land  use  and  management  vary  widely.  Some  Regosols  are  used  for  capital-intensive  irrigatedfarming but the most common landuse is low volume grazing. Regosols in mountain areas are best leftunder forest.,"1"
HISTOSOLS,"peat and muck soils; from Gr. histos, tissue.","Histosols occur extensively in boreal, arctic and subarctic regions. Elsewhere, they areconfined to poorly drained basins and depressions, swamp and marshlands with shallow groundwater,and highland areas with a high precipitation/evapotranspiration ratio.","Sustainable use of peat lands is limited to extensive forms of forestry or grazing. If carefully man-aged, Histosols can be very produc-tive under capital-intensive forms of arable cropping/horticulture,at the cost of sharply increased mineralization losses. Deep peat formations and peat in northern regionsare best left untouched. In places, peat bogs are mined, e.g. for production of growth substrate for hor-ticulture, or to fuel power stations. ","0.5"
